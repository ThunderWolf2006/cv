  <p>Hey! My name is Pavan and I am a self-taught programmer. I began Programming at the age of 12 as a hobby. Now, that is my main focus. I am currently learning advanced Python and JavaScript. My strong hand is Python and I am currently learning
    Web Development using <strong>Flask</strong>. For getting the best of flask, I also intent on learning <strong>CSS/HTML and JavaScript.</strong> I currently have no experience with any sort of project but will gladly work for any project within
    my level of expertise and experience.</p>
